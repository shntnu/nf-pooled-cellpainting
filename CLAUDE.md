# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Note**: Upstream (`broadinstitute/nf-pooled-cellpainting`) gitignores this file; this fork (`shntnu/nf-pooled-cellpainting`) tracks it so personal dev context travels with the repo. Team-shared contribution guidance lives in `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` (auto-imported below).

## Project Overview

nf-pooled-cellpainting is a Nextflow pipeline for processing optical pooled screening (OPS) data, combining Cell Painting phenotypic analysis with sequencing-by-synthesis barcoding. The pipeline processes microscopy images through two parallel arms and produces phenotypic measurements for each identified cell.

## Development Setup

**Note**: The pipeline runs entirely in Docker containers (CellProfiler, Fiji, etc.). End users only need Nextflow + Docker. This section covers the **developer environment** for working on the pipeline code.

This project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) to manage developer tools (nextflow, nf-test, nf-core, jupyter-book). Install pixi, then:

```bash
pixi install          # Install developer tools
pixi shell            # Activate environment (recommended for interactive work)
```

## Build and Test Commands

All commands assume you're in a `pixi shell` or prefixed with `pixi run`.

```bash
# Quick local tests (recommended for development)
pixi run test-illumcalc  # Illumination calculation module (~1 min)
pixi run test-segcheck   # Segmentation check module (~45s)

# Run all nf-test tests (modules + full pipeline, slow)
pixi run test

# Dry-run to check workflow logic without running containers
pixi run preview

# Run the pipeline with test profile
pixi run pipeline

# Lint the pipeline
pixi run lint

# Update schema after adding parameters
pixi run build-schema

# Clean up work directories
pixi run clean-work      # Remove work, results, .nextflow
pixi run clean-all-work  # Also remove .nf-test cache

# Documentation
pixi run serve-docs      # Serve docs locally (Jupyter Book at localhost:3000)
pixi run build-docs      # Build static HTML docs (output: docs/_build/html/)
pixi run clean-docs      # Remove docs build artifacts

# List all available tasks
pixi task list
```

### Without pixi (direct commands)

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker --outdir results -preview
nf-test test modules/local/cellprofiler/illumcalc/tests/main.nf.test --profile debug,test,docker
nf-core pipelines lint
```

nf-test runs always stack `debug,test,docker` profiles. On Apple Silicon add `arm`.

## Architecture

### Pipeline Structure

The pipeline has two parallel processing arms that run independently:

1. **Cell Painting arm** (`subworkflows/local/cellpainting/main.nf`):
   - Illumination calculation → Illumination apply → Segmentation check → Stitch & crop
   - Uses CellProfiler for image processing and Fiji for stitching
   - Outputs QC montages at each step

2. **Barcoding arm** (`subworkflows/local/barcoding/main.nf`):
   - Illumination calculation → Illumination apply → Barcode preprocessing → Stitch & crop
   - Additional QC for barcode alignment and cycle correlation
   - Groups images by cycle for illumination correction

3. **Combined analysis** (`workflows/nf-pooled-cellpainting.nf:118`):
   - Only runs when both `qc_painting_passed` and `qc_barcoding_passed` are `true`
   - Merges cropped images from both arms for final analysis

### Key Entry Points

- `main.nf` - Pipeline entry point, handles initialization and completion
- `workflows/nf-pooled-cellpainting.nf` - Main workflow orchestration
- `nextflow.config` - Global parameters and profile definitions

### Module Organization

- `modules/local/cellprofiler/` - CellProfiler processing steps (illumcalc, illumapply, segcheck, preprocess, combinedanalysis)
- `modules/local/fiji/stitchcrop/` - Image stitching and cropping with Fiji
- `modules/local/qc/` - QC modules (montageillum, barcodealign, preprocess)
- `modules/nf-core/multiqc/` - MultiQC reporting

### Data Flow Patterns

Channels are grouped by different keys depending on the processing step:

- **Illumination calculation**: Groups by `batch_plate` (painting) or `batch_plate_cycle` (barcoding)
- **Illumination apply**: Groups by site or well (controlled by `barcoding_illumapply_grouping`)
- **Stitch & crop**: Regroups all sites back to well level

### QC Checkpoints

The pipeline supports manual QC review at checkpoints. Set these parameters to proceed past QC:

- `--qc_painting_passed true` - Continue past painting QC to stitching/cropping
- `--qc_barcoding_passed true` - Continue past barcoding QC to stitching/cropping

Both must be true for combined analysis to run.

## Testing Notes

- Image processing outputs (CellProfiler, Fiji) have non-reproducible checksums due to floating point operations
- Snapshot tests verify file names and task counts rather than file contents
- Module tests (`modules/local/*/tests/`) are faster than full pipeline tests
- Full pipeline test (`tests/main.nf.test`) takes 5-10+ minutes as it runs actual CellProfiler/Fiji processing
- Test data is fetched from S3: `s3://nf-pooled-cellpainting-sandbox/`
- NullPointerException warnings from nf-test on macOS are expected (workflow.trace issue)
- Tests must be tagged `fast` or `slow` (nf-test doesn't support negation like `!slow`)
- New tests need `tag "fast"` or they won't run in CI fast mode

## Documentation (Jupyter Book / MyST)

- Docs source is in `docs/`, configured by `docs/myst.yml`
- Build must run from inside `docs/` (where `myst.yml` lives)
- `jupyter book build --html` produces static HTML; `--site` produces dynamic bundles (no `index.html`)
- GitHub Pages deployment requires `BASE_URL=/nf-pooled-cellpainting` for subpath serving
- `--strict` enables external link checking which is flaky in CI — avoid in workflows
- First TOC entry in `myst.yml` must be a plain `file:` (no children) — MyST constraint
- Docs CI workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) only triggers on `docs/**` path changes or `workflow_dispatch`

## Configuration

- `conf/base.config` - Default resource allocations
- `conf/modules.config` - Module-specific publish directories and options
- `conf/test.config` - Test profile with minimal dataset
- `conf/test_full.config` - Full-size test dataset (CI / release validation)
- `conf/test_cpg0032.config` - cpg0032 dataset profile
- `conf/*.resources_optimized.config` - Resource-tuned variants for constrained environments
- Container profiles: `docker`, `singularity`, `podman`, `apptainer`
- Use `-profile arm` with docker for Apple Silicon Macs

## Required Inputs

- `--input` - Samplesheet CSV with image paths and metadata
- `--barcodes` - Barcode reference CSV
- `--outdir` - Output directory
- CellProfiler pipeline files (`.cppipe`) for each processing step
